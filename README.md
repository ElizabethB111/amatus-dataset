# AMATUS Study Insights: Understanding Math Learning Anxiety

## Overview

AMATUS Study Insights is an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed to explore patterns of math learning anxiety, self-concept, and arithmetic performance among university students. The dashboard translates psychological survey data into accessible visual insights that can inform educational practice, particularly around instructional design and student support.

AMATUS stands for **Arithmetic Performance, Mathematics Anxiety, and Attitudes in Primary School Teachers and University Students**.

## What This Dashboard Explores

### 1. Overview of Psychological Test Scores
Users can explore how students scored across several self-reported measures, including:

- Math learning anxiety
- Test-related self-concepts
- Attitudes toward mathematics

### 2. Anxiety Triggers
This section visualizes correlations between specific math learning tasks and reported math anxiety.  

**Tasks examined include:**

- Watching math being demonstrated on the board
- Starting a new math topic
- Passive learning situations (lectures, peer explanations)

**Key Findings:**

- All examined tasks show relatively high correlations with math anxiety (0–1 scale)
- Visual and passive learning tasks exhibit the strongest associations
- Suggests anxiety is context-dependent

**Actionable Insight for Educators:**  
Reduce prolonged passive instruction and incorporate interactive strategies (narrated examples, manipulatives, mini whiteboards, guided problem solving).

### 3. Student Profiles: Patterns of Anxiety and Performance
The dashboard groups students into interpretable profiles based on performance and anxiety patterns.  

- Highlights that anxiety and performance do not always align
- Supports nuanced instructional responses
